Built an iOS app using swift and swiftUI as well as firebase for data storage and user authentication.
Followed tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_mypMqSXNw

Current features(from youtube tutorial):
- Allow users to sign in and sign up
- Allow users to add/delete items to do
  - Includes item name and deadline 
- Allow users to view simple profile details

Current features(built by myself):
- Add different folders/tabs/views to store different items
  - Motivation: As a university student I want to group my to do items by module

Future plans:
- Allow users to edit existing item details
  - Motivation: Allow user to save time by changing details instead of deleting and adding new tasks
- Add more pictures and aesthetics to improve user experience
